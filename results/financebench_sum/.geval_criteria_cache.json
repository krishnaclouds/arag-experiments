  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:coverage": "# Financial Document Summarization: Coverage Rubric\n\n## 1. Key Financial Metrics Inclusion\n\n**Score 1:** Summary mentions only revenue or only net income. Example: \"Company reported $2.5B in revenue\" but omits operating margins, EPS, or cash flow figures present in the source document.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes 2-3 major financial metrics (revenue, net income, EPS). Omits important supporting metrics like operating cash flow, debt levels, or segment performance breakdowns that would materially inform investment decisions.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures all material financial metrics including revenue, net income, EPS, operating cash flow, key margins, debt ratios, and segment performance. Reflects the complete financial picture without gaps in critical quantitative data.\n\n## 2. Forward Guidance & Outlook Completeness\n\n**Score 1:** No mention of management guidance or future outlook. Missing entirely or only vaguely references \"positive expectations\" without specific targets.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes high-level guidance (e.g., \"FY2024 revenue expected to grow\") but omits specific ranges, margin targets, or detailed assumptions underlying forecasts.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures specific guidance with quantitative targets (e.g., \"FY2024 revenue guidance of $2.8B-$2.9B; adjusted EBITDA margin target of 22-24%\"), including disclosed assumptions and risk factors affecting outlook.\n\n## 3. Business Driver & Context Explanation\n\n**Score 1:** Summary states facts without explanation. Example: \"Operating margin declined 300 bps\" with no mention of causes (tariffs, labor costs, pricing actions, mix shift).\n\n**Score 3:** Summary explains primary drivers of performance (e.g., mentions tariff impacts and volume decline) but misses secondary factors like product mix changes, geographic headwinds, or competitive dynamics affecting results.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary articulates full context including primary and secondary drivers\u2014e.g., \"Operating margin declined 300 bps due to 150 bps from tariff increases, 100 bps from unfavorable product mix, partially offset by 50 bps pricing realization.\"\n\n## 4. Risk & Headwind Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** No mention of risks, challenges, or headwinds. Presents only positive developments or ignores material concerns disclosed.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary acknowledges 1-2 major risks (e.g., supply chain disruption, regulatory uncertainty) but omits others like competitive pressures, FX exposure, or geopolitical impacts explicitly mentioned in source.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary covers material risks and headwinds across categories\u2014operational (supply chain), financial (FX, interest rates), competitive, regulatory, and macro\u2014proportional to emphasis in source document.\n\n## 6. Segment & Product Line Specificity\n\n**Score 1:** Summary treats company as undifferentiated whole. Example: \"Sales grew 5%\" without identifying which segments or products drove growth or lagged.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary identifies major segments and provides mixed performance picture (e.g., \"Software segment +12%, Hardware segment -3%\") but omits margin profiles or growth drivers specific to each segment.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary breaks down performance by relevant segments with revenue growth, margin contribution, and key drivers for each. Example: \"Cloud Services +28% (40% margins, benefiting from AI adoption), Legacy Products -8% (15% margins, declining as planned).\""
