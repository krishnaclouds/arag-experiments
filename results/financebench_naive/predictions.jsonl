For capital-intensive regulated utilities, working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) is typically **negative or near zero by design**, and this is not a sign of financial distress. Here's why:\n\n1. **Business Model**: Regulated utilities continuously invest in long-term infrastructure (pipes, treatment plants, etc.) funded by long-term debt and equity \u2014 not current assets. Their balance sheets are dominated by **long-lived fixed assets**, not liquid working capital.\n\n2. **Predictable Cash Flows**: Utilities have **stable, regulated revenue streams** that provide consistent operating cash flows, reducing the need to maintain large current asset buffers.\n\n3. **Debt Financing Structure**: Utilities routinely carry **significant short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt** on their balance sheets as part of normal financing activities, which mechanically depresses working capital.\n\n4. **Industry Norm**: Negative working capital is common and **expected** across the regulated utility sector and does not impair operations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRather than working capital, **more relevant metrics** for evaluating American Water Works' financial health include:\n- **Debt-to-equity or debt-to-capital ratios**\n- **Interest coverage ratio**\n- **Operating cash flow**\n- **Rate base growth**\n- **Return on equity (regulated)**\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f *Note: Specific FY2022 balance sheet figures were not provided in the context passages, so I cannot calculate the exact working capital figure.

The concept of \"gross margin\" (Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold, divided by Revenue) is fundamentally inapplicable to banking institutions for several key reasons:\n\n1. **No \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS):** Banks do not produce or sell physical goods. There is no direct production cost that can be cleanly separated from operating expenses in the traditional sense.\n\n2. **Revenue Structure is Fundamentally Different:** JPM's revenue is composed of:\n   - Net interest income (interest earned minus interest paid)\n   - Non-interest income (fees, trading revenues, investment banking fees, etc.)\n   These are **already net figures**, meaning the \"cost\" of generating interest income (interest expense) is typically netted out before arriving at reported revenue figures.\n\n3. **Industry-Specific Metrics Apply Instead:** Financial analysts evaluate banks using metrics specifically designed for the industry, such as:\n   - **Net Interest Margin (NIM):** Net interest income as a % of earning assets\n   - **Efficiency Ratio:** Non-interest expense divided by total net revenue (lower is better)\n   - **Return on Equity (ROE)**\n   - **Return on Assets (ROA)**\n   - **Tier 1 Capital Ratio**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNo context was provided with specific financial data, but regardless, **gross margin should not be used to evaluate JPMorgan Chase**. It is a metric designed for companies with distinct production costs, and applying it to a bank would produce a misleading or meaningless result.
