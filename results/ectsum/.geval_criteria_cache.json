Numerical Accuracy of Key Figures\n\n**Score 1:** Summary states \"Revenue increased by 15%\" when the source document shows 12% growth, or reports \"Q3 net income of $2.5B\" when actual figure is $2.1B.\n\n**Score 3:** All major financial metrics (revenue, net income, EPS) are within \u00b11% of source values, but minor figures (operating expenses, tax rates) may have small discrepancies that don't affect investment decisions.\n\n**Score 5:** Every financial figure\u2014including revenue, net income, EPS, margins, growth rates, and balance sheet items\u2014matches source documents exactly with no rounding discrepancies that would mislead investors.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Completeness of Material Guidance and Forward-Looking Statements\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits the company's FY2024 earnings guidance entirely, or mentions guidance exists without providing the actual range (e.g., \"management provided guidance\" with no figures).\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes primary guidance metrics (e.g., revenue growth range) but omits qualifications, key assumptions, or secondary guidance (e.g., margin outlook or capex guidance mentioned in transcript).\n\n**Score 5:** All material guidance\u2014revenue targets, margin expectations, capex plans, and explicitly stated caveats\u2014are captured with original ranges and management's confidence levels intact.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Attribution of Opinions vs. Facts\n\n**Score 1:** Summary states \"The supply chain disruptions have ended\" as fact when the source only contains a management opinion (\"we believe disruptions are ending\"), creating false certainty.\n\n**Score 2:** Summary frequently blurs management commentary with actual performance results without clear distinction.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary accurately distinguishes most facts from forward-looking statements, though occasionally an opinion is presented without attribution (\"management expects\" or \"company stated\").\n\n**Score 5:** Every factual claim is verifiable from source data, and all opinions, outlooks, and interpretations are clearly attributed to management or analysts with appropriate hedging language preserved.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Absence of Introduced Contradictions or Logical Inconsistencies\n\n**Score 1:** Summary states both \"operating margin expanded to 22%\" and \"margin compression pressured profitability\" when only one is supported by the source, creating investor confusion.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary is internally consistent, though it may emphasize certain facts in ways that create mild tonal misrepresentation of management's emphasis in the original source.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary maintains logical consistency throughout; no claims contradict each other or the source material; the narrative accurately reflects both challenges and opportunities discussed in the original document.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Completeness of Material Risk Disclosures and Negative Information\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits significant headwinds mentioned in source (e.g., doesn't mention a major customer loss, pending litigation, or revised downward guidance announced during earnings call).\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes primary risks (e.g., tariff exposure, competitive pressure) but omits secondary or emerging risks disclosed in the source, or lacks specificity about impact magnitude.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures all material risks and headwinds from the source\u2014litigation updates, customer concentration, regulatory challenges, margin pressures\u2014with relevant quantified impacts or severity levels, ensuring readers see a balanced view.",
  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:coverage": "# Financial Document Summarization Coverage Rubric\n\n## 1. Financial Metrics Inclusion\n**What this measures:** Whether all material financial figures (revenue, EPS, margins, cash flow) are captured.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary mentions \"strong performance\" but omits key metrics like gross margin decline from 42% to 38% or free cash flow figures entirely.\n- **Score 3:** Summary includes revenue ($2.5B, +12% YoY) and net income ($310M) but misses operating margin compression or one-time charges affecting comparability.\n- **Score 5:** Summary captures revenue, EPS, operating cash flow, net debt, and all material margins with prior-year comparisons and impact of one-time items clearly identified.\n\n## 2. Segment & Business Unit Coverage\n**What this measures:** Whether all reportable business segments and geographic regions with material performance are discussed.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary only discusses overall company performance; ignores that North America segment declined 15% or that Consumer division represents 40% of revenue.\n- **Score 3:** Summary addresses 2 of 3 major segments (e.g., discusses North America and Europe but omits Asia-Pacific growth trajectory) with limited detail on performance drivers.\n- **Score 5:** Summary covers all reportable segments with revenue/growth rates for each, highlights which segments are underperforming (e.g., Legacy Products -8%) and which are accelerating (Cloud +35%).\n\n## 3. Risk & Headwind Discussion\n**What this measures:** Whether material challenges, risks, and negative developments mentioned by management are represented.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary presents only positive outlook; completely omits discussion of supply chain delays, competitive pressure, or guidance reduction.\n- **Score 2:** Summary mentions challenges exist but lacks specificity (e.g., \"facing headwinds\" without explaining supply chain impact on Q3 margins by 150 bps).\n- **Score 3:** Summary addresses 2-3 major headwinds (tariff exposure, customer churn, regulatory changes) but underweights their financial impact or omits emerging risks.\n- **Score 5:** Summary identifies material risks with quantified impact (tariffs could reduce operating margin 200 bps; customer concentration in top 3 accounts = 35% of revenue; pending litigation exposure of $50M).\n\n## 4. Guidance & Forward-Looking Statements\n**What this measures:** Whether management's explicit guidance and outlook for future periods is accurately captured with specific targets or ranges.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary omits any guidance; reader has no view of management's expectations for FY2024 revenue growth or margin trajectory.\n- **Score 3:** Summary includes full-year revenue guidance ($10.5B-$10.8B) but omits EPS guidance range or margin outlook; lacks color on key assumptions.\n- **Score 5:** Summary states explicit guidance (revenue $10.5B-$10.8B, EPS $2.80-$3.00, operating margin 18-19%) and captures management commentary on growth drivers (AI adoption, international expansion) and headwinds affecting guidance.\n\n## 5. Strategic Initiatives & Actions\n**What this measures:** Whether material management actions, investments, and strategic initiatives affecting future performance are included.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary omits discussion of announced $500M acquisition, cost restructuring program, or product launch that management emphasized as pivotal.\n- **Score 3:** Summary mentions company is \"investing in growth\" and \"optimizing costs\" but lacks specificity on $300M R&D increase for AI products, planned headcount reduction of 8%, or divestiture of unprofitable division.\n- **Score 5:** Summary details specific initiatives with quantified impact: $300M R&D reallocation to cloud AI (expected to drive 40% growth by 2025), 2,000 job reduction generating $100M annual savings starting Q4, and planned sale of Legacy Services division (currently 12% of EBIT) expected to close in H1 2024."
