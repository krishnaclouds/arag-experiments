Instead, it explicitly refuses to generate the requested summary, stating \"I cannot produce a summary of 3M's FY2022 risk factors\" from the available corpus. While the refusal itself is appropriately cautious, the predicted output contains zero material figures to evaluate for accuracy. This represents a complete absence of numerical content rather than numerical errors, making it fundamentally non-responsive to the evaluation task.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 2: Qualification and Caveat Preservation\n**Score: 5**\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary appropriately qualifies every statement with explicit caveats. It clearly states:\n- \"all retrieved chunks are exclusively from **3M's FY2018 10-K filing**, not the FY2022 10-K\"\n- \"I cannot produce a summary of 3M's FY2022 risk factors from this corpus, as doing so would require me to fabricate information\"\n- \"This would violate the synthesis rules governing this task\"\n\nThe predicted output treats uncertainty and limitations with appropriate transparency and does not present speculative or unsupported claims as facts. This represents exemplary qualification of limitations.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 3: Attribution and Scope Clarity\n**Score: 5**\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary provides exceptionally clear attribution and scope boundaries:\n- Explicitly identifies the source corpus as \"FY2018 10-K filing, not FY2022\"\n- Specifies which chunks were retrieved and their content (cover page, table of contents, revenue disaggregation, etc.)\n- Notes that the actual risk factor text from FY2018 \"was not included in the retrieved chunks\"\n- Makes clear that a summary of FY2022 data cannot be responsibly provided from FY2018 documents\n\nThere is no confusion about sources, no false attribution, and no blurring of dates or filing periods.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 4: Omission of Material Information\n**Score: 5**\n\n**Reasoning:** While the predicted summary does not provide the requested FY2022 risk factor analysis, it does not *omit* material information that it claims to provide. Rather, it honestly states that the necessary source material is unavailable. The predicted output explicitly describes what *is* available in the corpus (FY2018 data only) and what is *not* available (FY2022 data). This represents full transparency about scope limitations rather than selective omission of material facts.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 5: Causal and Logical Coherence\n**Score: 5**\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary's logic is internally sound and consistent:\n- **Premise:** The task asks for FY2022 risk factors\n- **Observation:** Only FY2018 data is available in the corpus\n- **Inference:** Fabricating FY2022 summary from FY2018 data would violate synthesis rules\n- **Conclusion:** Cannot responsibly produce the requested summary\n\nThis logical chain is transparent, defensible, and creates no false causal relationships.

While the stated concern about document corpus mismatch (FY2018 vs. FY2022) is technically valid and intellectually honest, the response completely fails to deliver on the evaluation task itself. It provides:\n\n- Zero financial metrics\n- Zero management commentary\n- Zero risk factor analysis\n- Zero segment breakdown\n- Zero balance sheet coverage\n\nThe response prioritizes procedural correctness (acknowledging data limitations) over task completion, which results in a null summary with no evaluable content against any of the five coverage criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Final Score: 1**\n\nThe predicted summary scores a 1 across all five criteria because it provides no substantive financial, operational, or risk-related content whatsoever.

It explicitly states that no relevant document chunks were retrieved and therefore declines to provide financial figures. Since no numbers are asserted, there are no numerical errors. This is the appropriate response given the source context limitation.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 2: Qualification and Caveat Preservation\n**Score: 5**\n\nThe predicted summary appropriately qualifies its inability to answer by clearly stating: \"There is **no information about Activision Blizzard or FY2019** present in any of the retrieved chunks\" and \"I am unable to answer the question...based on the available document corpus.\" The summary does not present uncertain or conditional information as fact; instead, it transparently communicates the constraint. This is the correct handling of the situation.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 3: Attribution and Scope Clarity\n**Score: 5**\n\nThe predicted summary correctly attributes the limitation to the source material (\"The document corpus provided contains only 3M...filing information\") and clearly indicates what information is available versus what is absent.

However, the summary appropriately communicates this absence rather than fabricating content or providing a summary that doesn't match the source material. The summary correctly identifies that material information cannot be provided due to source limitations.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 5: Causal and Logical Coherence\n**Score: 5**\n\nThe predicted summary's logic is sound and coherent: (1) the source context explicitly states no relevant chunks were retrieved, (2) the reference summary is about Activision Blizzard FY2019, and (3) therefore, the predicted summary correctly concludes that it cannot provide the requested information.

Instead, it claims that no relevant source material exists.

The predicted summary appears to have rejected a valid source document, claiming only \"3M...10-K filing information\" is available.\n\nThis represents a **fundamental failure of the task**: the predicted summary should be evaluated against the reference summary, but the predicted response refuses to engage with the reference material. If the source chunks were genuinely unavailable, this would be appropriate; however, the reference summary itself constitutes the source that should have been summarized.\n\n**Final Score: 1**\n\n**Rationale:** While the predicted summary is technically accurate in assessing its own source material constraints, it fails at the core task of faithfully summarizing the reference financial document provided. A score of 1 is appropriate because the summary does not attempt to capture any of the material financial information that was available (the reference summary itself), effectively omitting all substantive content that should have been summarized.

The evaluator correctly identifies that no chunks were retrieved and declines to make unverified numerical claims.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 2: Qualification and Caveat Preservation\n**Score: 5**\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary demonstrates excellent preservation of qualifications and contingencies:\n- Uses appropriately tentative language: \"could materially impair,\" \"pose a threat,\" \"could adversely affect,\" \"There is no assurance that\"\n- Distinguishes between actual risks and potential outcomes (e.g., \"While no material IT incident had occurred as of the filing date, such events could result in...\")\n- Preserves the conditional nature of forward-looking statements\n- The summary explicitly notes in the opening that \"no explicit risk factor disclosures are included\" in the reference material and that observations are \"derived strictly from the financial data presented\" \u2014 a critical caveat\n\nThe tone throughout appropriately reflects uncertainty and contingency rather than asserting definitive outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 3: Attribution and Scope Clarity\n**Score: 5**\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary excels at attribution and scope clarity:\n- **Opens with a major disclaimer** identifying a document mismatch (Amazon FY2017 vs. 3M FY2018)\n- **Clearly attributes all statements to 3M's FY2018 10-K filing** rather than presenting them as company assertions\n- Distinguishes between \"disclosed risks\" (actual risk factors) and implied risks\n- Explicitly notes that risk factors come from a formal 10-K document section\n- Closes with a clear note reaffirming the source material is \"3M's FY2018 10-K\"\n- Uses precise language: \"3M's strategy includes,\" \"3M's growth objectives depend,\" \"3M relies on\"\n\nThe critical issue (document mismatch) is flagged transparently at the outset, which is the appropriate level of attribution and scope clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 4: Omission of Material Information\n**Score: 3\u20134 (erring toward 4)**\n\n**Reasoning:** \n\n**Strengths:**\n- The summary captures the major risk categories typically disclosed in 10-K Item 1A sections: competitive risks, currency risk, product development, supply chain, M&A, operational transformation, cybersecurity, pension/financial market, and credit/liquidity.\n- The summary avoids false omissions given that **the actual source material (chunks) was not provided** \u2014 the evaluator transparently notes this limitation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Limitations:**\n- The summary makes claims about 3M's FY2018 10-K content without having been provided the actual text chunks (note states \"(no chunks retrieved)\").\n- While the predicted summary reads authoritatively regarding 3M's disclosed risks, there is **no way to verify** whether material risk factors have been omitted.\n- The opening caveat that \"no explicit risk factor disclosures are included\" contrad", "geval_coverage": 5, "geval_coverage_reasoning": "# Coverage Evaluation: Predicted Summary vs. Rubric\n\n## Criterion 1: Key Financial Metrics Inclusion\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary is explicitly a **risk factors summary**, not a financial metrics summary. It contains no income statement metrics (revenue, net income, margins, EPS), no cash flow data, no balance sheet line items, and no guidance. The summary correctly identifies this limitation and states it is \"based solely on risk factors disclosed.\"\n\nHowever, the evaluation rubric explicitly requires assessment of \"revenue, profitability measures, cash flow, guidance, and segment-level or product-line performance.\" The predicted summary provides **none of these**.\n\n**Score for Criterion 1: 1** \u2014 The summary omits all primary financial metrics (revenue, profitability, cash flow, guidance, segments) that are material to a 10-K evaluation.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 2: Management Commentary & Rationale Coverage\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary provides risk factor **descriptions** without management's stated rationale for performance changes or strategic initiatives. For example:\n- It states \"revenues and profit margins are exposed to competitive pressures\" but does not reference management commentary explaining FY2018 performance drivers.\n- It mentions \"60% of revenues are generated outside the United States\" but lacks commentary on how currency movement actually impacted FY2018 results.\n- It discusses ERP implementation as a risk but does not connect this to management's forward guidance or expected productivity benefits.\n\nThe summary reads as extracted risk factor language rather than management-contextualized explanation of performance variances or strategic rationale.\n\n**Score for Criterion 2: 2** \u2014 The summary captures risk factor text but lacks substantive management commentary explaining business performance, strategic initiatives, or forward-looking statements tied to actual results.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 3: Risk Factors & Headwinds Disclosure\n\n**Reasoning:** This is the **primary focus** of the predicted summary. It systematically identifies and describes 8 material risk categories:\n1. Competitive & Market Risks\n2. Foreign Currency Risk (with 60% revenue exposure quantified)\n3. New Product Development Risk\n4. Supply Chain & Raw Material Risk\n5. Acquisition & Portfolio Management Risk\n6. Productivity & Business Transformation Risk (with specific tool references: Lean Six Sigma, ERP)\n7. Cybersecurity & IT Risk (with note that no material incident had occurred)\n8. Pension & Financial Market Risk\n9. Credit & Liquidity Risk\n\nThe summary provides specificity where available (60% foreign revenue exposure, ERP implementation details, mention of no prior material IT incident).\n\n**Score for Criterion 3: 5** \u2014 The summary comprehensively captures material risk factors disclosed in 3M's 10-K with appropriate specificity and context.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 4: Segment & Product Line Breakdown\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary contains **no segment, geography, or product-line breakdown**. It does not reference 3M's major operating segments (Safety and Graphics, Health Care, Industrial, Consumer, etc.), does not break out geographic performance, and does not discuss product-line specific performance or risks.\n\nA 10-K evaluation rubric expects segment-level detail where material. The summary's omission of this is material.\n\n**Score for Criterion 4: 1** \u2014 The summary provides no segment, geography, or product-line breakdown despite 3M being a diversified company with multiple operating segments.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 5: Balance Sheet & Capital Allocation Coverage\n\n**Reasoning:** The predicted summary contains **no balance sheet information**:", "retrieval_recall": 0.0, "retrieval_precision": 0.0, "rouge2_f1": 0.056, "word_count": 469, "loops": 1, "cost_usd": 0.030531, "latency_ms": 16808, "error_codes": []}

It is a procedural statement, not a financial summary.\n\n### Criterion 2: Qualification and Caveat Preservation\n**Score: N/A (Not Applicable)**\nThe predicted text does not attempt to summarize any facts, qualifications, or caveats. It therefore cannot fail on this dimension.\n\n### Criterion 3: Attribution and Scope Clarity\n**Score: N/A (Not Applicable)**\nNo attributions or scope claims are made in the predicted text since no summary content is provided.\n\n### Criterion 4: Omission of Material Information\n**Score: 1 (Critical Failure)**\nThe predicted text **completely omits all material information** that should be summarized. The reference summary identifies critical risk factors including:\n- Leverage and debt burden deterioration ($12.1B to $13.4B debt; equity decline from $11.6B to $9.8B)\n- Aggressive capital returns exceeding operating cash flow ($8.1B deployed vs. $6.4B OCF)\n- Foreign exchange exposure ($160M headwind in 2018)\n- Minnesota NRD settlement ($850M charge in Q1 2018)\n- Litigation risks (Combat Arms Earplugs, respirators, environmental claims)\n- PFAS/PFOS contamination risks\n- Pension obligations ($2.99B liability)\n- Liquidity tightening (cash down $200M, marketable securities down $700M)\n\nBy refusing to provide any summary content, the predicted response omits **all** material facts that would inform investment decision-making.\n\n### Criterion 5: Causal and Logical Coherence\n**Score: N/A (Not Applicable)**\nNo causal chains or logical relationships are presented; therefore, no incoherence can occur.\n\n---\n\n## Fundamental Issue\n\nThe predicted summary is not a summary\u2014it is a request for additional information. This represents a **complete failure to complete the assigned task**. Rather than synthesizing the substantial source material already retrieved (7 chunks with detailed risk factor disclosures), the model declines to produce any substantive output.\n\nThe reference summary demonstrates that adequate source material was available to produce a comprehensive risk factor analysis. The predicted response's assertion that \"more information\" is needed is factually incorrect given the extensive chunks already retrieved.\n\n---\n\n## Final Score: **1**\n\nThe predicted output scores 1 because it provides zero summary content and therefore **completely omits all material information** required for the task.

It is merely a placeholder statement indicating information needs to be retrieved. There is no explanation of business drivers, performance changes, strategic initiatives, or forward-looking management statements.\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 3: Risk Factors & Headwinds Disclosure\n\n**Score: 1**\n\nWhile the agent has retrieved extensive chunks containing detailed risk disclosures (litigation, PFAS/PFOS contamination, competitive dynamics, supply chain, cybersecurity, macro headwinds, pension obligations, debt risks, etc.), the **predicted summary itself** contains zero risk factor content. The response is a retrieval request, not a summary of risks.\n\nThe reference summary, by contrast, systematically captures material risks with financial impact specificity (debt-to-equity deterioration, $8.1B capital deployment vs. $6.4B operating cash flow, $160M FX headwind, $2.99B pension liabilities, $850M Minnesota NRD settlement, goodwill impairment risk, and liquidity compression).\n\n---\n\n## Criterion 4: Segment & Product Line Breakdown\n\n**Score: 1**\n\nThe predicted summary provides no segment, geography, or product-line information whatsoever.

The reference summary, by contrast, provides comprehensive coverage: long-term debt ($13.4B vs. $12.1B), equity decline ($9.8B vs. $11.6B), debt-to-equity deterioration, share repurchases ($4.87B), dividends ($3.19B), operating cash flow ($6.4B), cash position ($2.85B), and pension obligations ($2.99B with $370M contributions).\n\n---\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nThe predicted summary is **not a summary at all**. It is a methodological statement indicating the agent recognizes more information is needed and proceeds to retrieve risk factor disclosures.
