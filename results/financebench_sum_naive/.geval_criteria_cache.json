  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:faithfulness": "# Faithfulness Rubric for Financial Document Summarization\n\n## 1. Numerical Accuracy\n\n**Score 1:** Summary contains material numerical errors that could affect investment decisions.\n- *Example:* Original states \"revenue increased 15% YoY to $2.3B\"; summary claims \"$2.3B representing a 25% increase\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes correct key figures but omits important numerical details or comparative contexts.\n- *Example:* Original discusses revenue growth of 15% in North America and 8% in Europe; summary only states \"double-digit growth in key regions\"\n\n**Score 5:** All material figures are accurate and appropriately contextualized (YoY, QoQ, or absolute values) matching source precision levels.\n- *Example:* Original: \"Q3 revenue $2.3B (+15% YoY, -3% QoQ)\"; summary captures all three metrics accurately\n\n---\n\n## 2. Qualification and Caveat Preservation\n\n**Score 1:** Summary removes critical qualifications, presenting uncertain or conditional statements as facts.\n- *Example:* Original: \"We expect 8-10% growth *assuming* no further supply chain disruptions\"; summary: \"Company will grow 8-10%\"\n\n**Score 2:** Summary removes critical qualifications, presenting uncertain or conditional statements as facts.\n- *Example:* Original: \"We expect 8-10% growth *assuming* no further supply chain disruptions\"; summary: \"Company will grow 8-10%\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes some qualifications but loses nuance on management confidence levels or contingencies.\n- *Example:* Original: \"We *may* achieve profitability by Q4, *if* costs decline as expected\"; summary: \"Profitability expected by Q4\"\n\n**Score 5:** All material qualifications, contingencies, and confidence indicators are preserved (e.g., \"expects,\" \"subject to,\" \"at risk,\" guidance ranges).\n- *Example:* Original and summary both convey: \"Guidance of 8-10% growth assumes stable commodity prices\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Attribution and Scope Clarity\n\n**Score 1:** Summary attributes statements to the company without indicating they are management projections, analyst questions, or competitor references.\n- *Example:* Original is analyst question about market share; summary presents it as company assertion: \"Market share will reach 35%\"\n\n**Score 2:** Summary attributes statements to the company without indicating they are management projections, analyst questions, or competitor references.\n- *Example:* Original is analyst question about market share; summary presents it as company assertion: \"Market share will reach 35%\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary generally attributes statements correctly but occasionally blurs guidance (forward-looking) with results (actual) or omits source of specific claims.\n- *Example:* Original: \"*We anticipate* margins will improve\" appears in summary without the forward-looking qualifier distinction\n\n**Score 5:** Summary clearly distinguishes actual results, management guidance, analyst commentary, and risks; uses precise attributions (e.g., \"management stated,\" \"guidance assumes,\" \"disclosed risks include\").\n\n---\n\n## 4. Omission of Material Information\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits multiple material facts that substantially change the interpretation of financial health or performance.\n- *Example:* Original discusses $500M one-time charge, significant litigation, and customer concentration; summary mentions only revenue growth\n\n**Score 3:** Summary captures main narrative but omits secondary but material details (e.g., one of three cost headwinds, geographic segment performance, or executive changes).\n- *Example:* Original discusses margin pressure from labor costs, freight, and tariffs; summary mentions only labor costs\n\n**Score 5:** Summary includes all facts material to investment decision-making; omissions, if any, are genuinely immaterial or addressed through selectivity (not carelessness).\n- *Example:* Minor historical context omitted is acceptable; omitting current-period write-downs is not\n\n---\n\n## 5. Causal and Logical Coherence\n\n**Score 1:** Summary contradicts source document logic or creates false causal chains that mislead readers.\n- *Example:* Original: \"Despite cost increases, we maintained margins through operational efficiency\"; summary: \"Cost increases compressed margins significantly\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary captures main causal relationships but simplifies or slightly misrepresents the chain of logic.\n- *Example:* Original: \"Revenue growth was driven 60% by price increases and 40% by volume; price increases were necessary due to cost inflation\"; summary:",
  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:coverage": "# Financial Document Summarization: Coverage Evaluation Rubric\n\n## 1. Key Financial Metrics Inclusion\n\n**Score 1:** Summary mentions only revenue or only net income, omitting other critical metrics. *Example: Reports \"Q3 revenue grew 12%\" but excludes gross margin, operating margin, and EPS.*\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes 3-4 of the most material financial metrics relevant to the document. *Example: Covers revenue growth, net income, EPS, and operating cash flow, but omits guidance or segment performance.*\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures all material financial metrics appropriate to the document scope, including revenue, profitability measures, cash flow, guidance, and segment-level or product-line performance where material. *Example: Systematically covers revenue by segment, gross/operating/net margins, EPS (GAAP and adjusted), FCF, and forward guidance with specificity.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Management Commentary & Rationale Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** Summary reports numbers without management's stated reasons for performance changes. *Example: States \"operating expenses increased 18%\" with no mention of management's explanation about restructuring costs or technology investments.*\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes selective management commentary explaining 50-70% of material variances or business developments. *Example: Explains revenue growth drivers and one major cost increase, but omits commentary on competitive dynamics or market headwinds.*\n\n**Score 5:** Summary consistently captures management's rationale for significant performance changes, strategic initiatives, and forward-looking statements. *Example: Explains revenue growth by product line with stated reasons, justifies margin compression with pricing and mix commentary, and includes management's outlook on demand trends.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Risk Factors & Headwinds Disclosure\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits discussion of identified risks, challenges, or negative developments. *Example: Summarizes strong revenue growth but fails to mention management's warning about supply chain delays or pricing pressure in key markets.*\n\n**Score 3:** Summary identifies 1-2 material risks or headwinds mentioned in the document. *Example: Notes increased raw material costs and competitive pressure, but misses currency headwinds or customer concentration issues.*\n\n**Score 5:** Summary systematically captures material risks, challenges, and headwinds disclosed, with specificity about impact and mitigation strategies where discussed. *Example: Covers supply chain disruption risks with estimated margin impact, customer concentration thresholds, regulatory exposure, and management's mitigation actions.*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Segment & Product Line Breakdown\n\n**Score 1:** Summary provides only company-wide totals with no segment, geography, or product-line detail despite material variation across segments. *Example: Reports consolidated revenue growth of 8% without breaking down performance across North America, Europe, and Asia regions that grew at 2%, 12%, and 15% respectively.*\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes segment-level metrics for 2-3 major segments or geographies, with partial coverage of performance drivers. *Example: Breaks out North America and International revenue with growth rates, but omits product category or margin performance by segment.*\n\n**Score 5:** Summary provides comprehensive segment, geography, and/or product-line breakdown with growth rates and profitability metrics where material, enabling investors to assess diversification and growth drivers. *Example: Details revenue and margin by segment (Cloud, Legacy, Services) with growth rates and contribution %, highlighting shifts in mix.*\n\n---\n\n## 5. Balance Sheet & Capital Allocation Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits balance sheet, liquidity, debt levels, or capital allocation entirely. *Example: Focuses solely on income statement while company discusses major debt refinancing or dividend changes.*\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes selective balance sheet items or capital allocation actions (1-2 items). *Example: Mentions debt reduction but omits cash position, working capital changes, or capital expenditure guidance.*\n\n**Score 5:** Summary covers material balance sheet metrics (cash, debt, leverage ratios where relevant), working capital changes, capital expenditure plans, and capital allocation priorities (dividends, buybacks, M&A, debt paydown). *Example: Reports cash position, net debt/EBITDA ratio, CapEx guidance as % of revenue, and management's stated capital allocation priorities.*"
