  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:faithfulness": "# Financial Document Summarization: Faithfulness Rubric\n\n## 1. Numerical Accuracy\n\n**Definition:** Financial figures (revenue, EPS, margins, etc.) match source documents without material errors.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary states \"Q3 revenue grew 15%\" when the source document clearly states 8% YoY growth. Investor decisions materially affected by the error.\n\n- **Score 3:** Summary correctly reports $2.5B revenue but rounds gross margin from 42.3% to 42%, with no context that rounding occurred. Minor inaccuracy unlikely to change investment thesis.\n\n- **Score 5:** All reported figures precisely match source documentation. When rounding is necessary, it's noted or consistently applied (e.g., \"approximately $2.5B\"). Decimal precision preserved for material metrics.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Contextual Completeness for Material Facts\n\n**Definition:** Summary includes necessary qualifications, conditions, or explanations that prevent misinterpretation.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary states \"Company divested its Asian operations\" without mentioning that the divestiture resulted in a $400M one-time loss, leading investors to misjudge normalized earnings quality.\n\n- **Score 3:** Summary mentions guidance was \"withdrawn\" but omits that management cited \"unprecedented supply chain disruption,\" leaving readers uncertain about permanence of the guidance change.\n\n- **Score 5:** Summary includes: \"GAAP EPS declined 22% ($1.08 vs $1.38 prior year), primarily due to $0.35/share one-time restructuring charges; adjusted EPS grew 8%.\" Readers can distinguish operating performance from non-recurring items.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Attribution of Claims to Evidence\n\n**Definition:** Statements are sourced or clearly attributed to verifiable statements in the original document, not speculation or inference.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary claims \"Management expects strong international expansion in 2024\" when the actual quote was \"We are exploring international opportunities\" with no explicit growth expectations stated.\n\n- **Score 3:** Summary references \"Management commentary on inflation\" without specifying whether the statement was in prepared remarks, Q&A, or footnotes, making verification moderately difficult.\n\n- **Score 5:** Summary distinguishes between direct management guidance (\"On a call, CFO stated Q4 organic growth will be 4-6%\"), management tone (\"Multiple executives emphasized margin pressure\"), and documented facts (\"SEC filing discloses 3 pending litigations\").\n\n---\n\n## 4. Completeness of Key Disclaimers and Risk Disclosures\n\n**Definition:** Forward-looking statements, contingencies, and material risks from source documents are reflected in the summary.\n\n- **Score 1:** Summary highlights \"Expected 30% margin expansion\" from management guidance without mentioning the accompanying disclosure that \"results depend on successful completion of acquisition and regulatory approval, which is uncertain.\"\n\n- **Score 3:** Summary notes company faces \"competition\" as a risk but omits the specific disclosure that three major customers represent 45% of revenue, creating concentration risk.\n\n- **Score 5:** Summary captures: \"Management projects $3B cost savings by 2026, contingent on successful restructuring (currently underway with execution risks noted); simultaneously, company disclosed rising raw material costs may limit margin upside if not passed to customers.\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Consistency of Terminology and Metrics\n\n**Definition:** Financial terms, metrics, and definitions used in the summary align with how they are defined and used in source documents.\n\n- **Score 1:** Source document consistently uses \"Adjusted EBITDA\" with a specific add-back calculation throughout; summary mixes terminology, sometimes calling it \"EBITDA\" and sometimes \"EBITDA (adjusted),\" creating ambiguity about which figure is cited.\n\n- **Score 3:** Summary uses \"organic growth\" in one section and \"constant-currency growth\" in another. Both terms appear in the source document but lack clear delineation of which figure applies where, creating potential misreading.\n\n- **Score 5:** Summary consistently uses terminology as defined in source document. First mention includes parenthetical: \"organic revenue growth (excluding acquisitions and divestitures) of 5%.\" All subsequent uses of \"organic growth\" clearly reference this definition without repetition.",
  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:coverage": "# Financial Document Summarization: Coverage Rubric\n\n## 1. Key Financial Metrics Inclusion\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits critical figures. Example: A quarterly earnings summary mentions \"revenue grew\" but excludes actual revenue figures ($2.5B), gross margin (62%), or EPS ($1.23).\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes most primary metrics but may miss secondary ones. Example: Includes revenue ($2.5B) and EPS ($1.23) but omits gross margin, operating cash flow, or year-over-year comparisons.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures all material financial metrics relevant to the document. Example: Revenue ($2.5B, +12% YoY), gross margin (62%, +200 bps), operating income ($480M), EPS ($1.23), and free cash flow ($340M) all included with appropriate context.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Forward-Guidance Completeness\n\n**Score 1:** Summary contains no forward-looking statements or guidance. Example: A transcript mentioning \"we expect Q3 revenue between $2.3-2.5B and adjusted EPS of $1.15-1.30\" is completely absent from summary.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes some guidance but incompletely. Example: Notes management's optimistic outlook but omits specific guidance ranges, time horizons, or conditional factors affecting projections.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures quantified guidance with qualifications. Example: \"FY2024 revenue guidance: $9.8-10.2B; adjusted EPS: $4.50-4.75, assuming 3-4% market growth and no major M&A activity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Risk Factor and Headwind Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** Summary ignores risk disclosures or challenges. Example: A filing section discussing supply chain vulnerabilities, regulatory changes, or competitive pressure receives no mention in the summary.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary mentions some risks but lacks depth or specificity. Example: Notes \"competitive challenges exist\" without identifying specific competitors, market share losses, or pricing pressure impacts.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary identifies material risks with concrete details. Example: \"Supply chain delays in Southeast Asia could reduce Q2 margins by 150-200 bps; pending regulatory changes may require $50M compliance investment; competitor X gained 3% market share.\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. Segment/Product Line Breakdown\n\n**Score 1:** Summary treats company as monolithic; no segment-level detail. Example: A company with distinct Cloud, Legacy, and Services segments only receives a single revenue figure with no disaggregation.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary covers major segments but with uneven detail. Example: Cloud segment ($1.2B, +25%) and Services ($340M, +8%) are mentioned, but Legacy segment ($800M, -5%) receives minimal discussion.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary includes all material segments with comparable metrics. Example: \"Cloud: $1.2B (+25% YoY, 40% margins); Services: $340M (+8%, 35% margins); Legacy: $800M (-5%, 28% margins); Cloud now 48% of revenue.\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Management Commentary and Rationale Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** Summary contains only facts with no explanatory context. Example: \"Revenue fell 8%\" with no mention of management's explanation (e.g., intentional customer mix shift, divestitures, or pricing strategy).\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes some management commentary but selectively. Example: Mentions management's explanation for revenue decline but omits their commentary on margin expansion drivers or strategic investments made during the period.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures management's reasoning for performance drivers and strategic decisions. Example: \"Revenue declined 8% ($200M) primarily due to planned exit from low-margin contracts (CFO: 'trading volume for profitability'); margins expanded 280 bps as higher-margin cloud solutions grew to 48% of mix.\""
