Finally, we're very excited to share our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month, and we'll be providing a strategic update of our long-term plans on April 20. With that, I'll pass the call to Jeff to discuss our financial results in greater detail as well as our 2021 guidance. I too would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all our team members for the extraordinary focus and effort throughout 2020 despite the unprecedented times. Our entire team adjusted, adapted and continued to execute our priorities. In Q4, our net sales of $2.4 billion increased 12%. Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 192 basis points to 45.9%.\ndriven primarily by inventory-related items, cost and price improvements as well as supply chain leverage. As our primary focus throughout the year was on the health and safety of our team members and customers, we temporarily paused our physical inventory counts earlier this year. When we resumed these in Q4, our actual shrink rates were far better than we had anticipated. This resulted in a benefit in inventory-related costs due to a reduction in the reserve to reflect the positive result. LIFO-related impacts were a tailwind this quarter versus prior year. This will be the last quarter we included LIFO impacts in our adjusted financial results as we will begin reporting in Q1 2021 excluding any benefits or expenses from LIFO and our adjusted financial measures. We believe this adjustment creates a more accurate picture of our operational results and is more in line with industry practices. Our Q4 adjusted SG&A expense was $913.5 million. On a rate basis, this represented 38.6% of net sales compared to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The single biggest driver of this increase was $19 million in COVID-related costs directly attributable to the unanticipated spike in case rates. We also incurred higher Q4 medical claims as a result of lower claims during the prior quarters. In addition, our short-term incentive compensation for both field and corporate team members was higher than prior year. Separately, we invested behind the launch of The DieHard is Back campaign. We also incurred lease termination costs related to the ongoing optimization of our real estate footprint. We believe these expected investments in DieHard and lease optimization will result in top and bottom line improvements. Despite higher SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income increased 14.6% in Q4 to $171.8 million. On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 17 basis points. Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.87, up 14% from prior year despite a $0.22 impact in the quarter from COVID expenses. For the full year, which includes an additional week versus 2019, we delivered record net sales of $10.1 billion, which increased 4.1%. The 53rd, added approximately $158 million to sales. Our adjusted gross profit increased 5% year-over-year and adjusted gross profit margin expanded 38 basis points. Adjusted SG&A expense for full year 2020 increased 5.2% from 2019 results. This was primarily the result of COVID-related expenses totaling $60 million. Our adjusted operating income increased 4.1% to $827.3 million. And our OI margins was 8.2%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusting for the $60 million in COVID costs, our adjusted operating income margin expanded 59 basis points. Our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.51, which is a new record for Advance and includes a headwind of $0.66 related to COVID costs. We estimate the impact of the 53rd week was a tailwind from approximately $20 million to adjusted operating income and a benefit of approximately $0.23 to our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year.\n\n</tool_response>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"semantic_search\", \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"2021 guidance net sales operating income\", \"doc_id\": \"ectsum_0002\"}}\n</tool_call>\n\n<tool_response>\n[Chunk 12]\n[DOC_ID: ectsum_0002 | COMPANY:  | TYPE: EARNINGS_CALL | PERIOD:  | SECTION: transcript] For 2021, we expect net sales of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, adjusted gross profit margin of 45.8% to 46.2%, adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales of 37.5% to 38%, adjusted operating income margin of 7.8% to 8.2%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $11 to $11.50, and capital expenditures of $225 million to $250 million.

I'm pleased to report that Aaron's Business delivered strong fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Our team members' dedication and hard work throughout the year enabled us to deliver strong financial results while serving our customers and communities during a challenging year. In the fourth quarter, revenues increased 7.5% to $446.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.5% to $44.5 million. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis increased 11.3% to $0.79. For the full year, revenues increased 7.3% to $1.73 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.5% to $155.8 million. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis increased 22.5% to $3.27. These results were driven by strong customer payment activity, reduced lease merchandise write-offs and disciplined cost management. The spin-off of Aaron's Holdings into two separate publicly traded companies was completed on November 30, 2020. Aaron's Holdings separated into The Aaron's Company, which operates and franchises Aaron's stores, and PROG Holdings, which is the parent company of Progressive Leasing, Vive Financial and Four. The spin-off creates two focused companies, each with distinct strategies, financial profiles and capital allocation priorities. The Aaron's Company is now a pure-play lease-to-own retailer with a strong balance sheet and cash flows. We believe the spin-off will allow each company to better serve its customers, team members and shareholders. We are excited about the future of Aaron's and the opportunity ahead of us.\n\n---\n\n[Chunk 4]\n[DOC_ID: ectsum_0001 | COMPANY:  | TYPE: EARNINGS_CALL | PERIOD:  | SECTION: transcript] In the fourth quarter, same-store revenues increased 7.5% and lease portfolio size increased 5.5% at the end of the quarter. The lease portfolio size is a leading indicator of future revenues. The increase in lease portfolio size was driven by strong customer demand and improved decisioning technology. Our new decisioning technology has been a key driver of our improved financial results. The technology has allowed us to approve more customers while simultaneously reducing write-offs. In the fourth quarter, write-offs were 4.3% of revenues, down 300 basis points from the prior year. We ended the year with 1,302 company-operated stores and 228 franchised stores. During the fourth quarter, we closed 11 company-operated stores and opened 1 new store. For the full year, we closed 82 company-operated stores and opened 5 new stores. We are continuing to optimize our store footprint by closing underperforming stores and investing in our remaining stores. We are also investing in our e-commerce capabilities to better serve our customers. E-commerce revenues increased approximately 35% in 2020. We are excited about the opportunity to grow our e-commerce business and better serve our customers. We are also investing in our GenNext store remodel program. We have remodeled 123 stores to the GenNext format. These stores are performing well and we are excited about the opportunity to continue to remodel our store base.\n\n---\n\n[Chunk 5]\n[DOC_ID: ectsum_0001 | COMPANY:  | TYPE: EARNINGS_CALL | PERIOD:  | SECTION: transcript] We are also investing in our real estate strategy. We are working to right-size our store footprint and reduce our occupancy costs. We are also investing in our supply chain to improve our efficiency and reduce our costs. We are excited about the opportunity to improve our financial results through these investments. We are also investing in our team members. We are focused on improving our team member experience and reducing our turnover. We are also investing in our technology to improve our operations and better serve our customers. We are excited about the opportunity to improve our financial results through these investments. In summary, we are excited about the future of Aaron's and the opportunity ahead of us. We believe the spin-off creates two focused companies, each with distinct strategies, financial profiles and capital allocation priorities. The Aaron's Company is now a pure-play lease-to-own retailer with a strong balance sheet and cash flows. We believe the spin-off will allow each company to better serve its customers, team members and shareholders. We are excited about the future of Aaron's and the opportunity ahead of us.

I'll come back later to talk about the next steps in our journey and our strategy. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. Ag Services results were substantially higher year-over-year. Results were driven by a record Q1 for our North American origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong Chinese demand. As expected, results in South America were significantly lower versus the prior year period. Farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter. Lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected South American results. Results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight positions. Those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. Crushing delivered its best quarter ever as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. Net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year. While overall volumes were down due to pandemic impacts, margins were stronger in both North America and EMEA, refined oils. Global biodiesel results were lower year-over-year. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the prior year period. Looking ahead, we now expect full year calendar year results for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be higher than the record 2020, with a particularly strong fourth quarter, driven by potentially record global demand for North American agricultural products. For the second quarter, we expect results to be slightly stronger than the second quarter of 2020, but significantly lower than the record first quarter of 2021 with stronger Crushing and RPO expectations compared to the second quarter of 2020, offsetting seasonably lower Ag Service results. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered significant year-over-year profit growth. Our Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes the wet mill ethanol production, achieved significantly higher results versus the first quarter of 2020. The business managed risks exceptionally well, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable coal product values in an industry environment of improving margins and falling inventories. Corn oil results were significantly higher than the previous year, which have been impacted by substantial mark-to-market effects. In general, though demand for sweeteners and flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year, there were signs of acceleration in the month of March. Starch sales volumes remained solid on demand from industrial applications like packaging materials. Vantage Corn Processor results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in USP-grade industrial alcohol. Looking ahead, second quarter results for Carbohydrate Solutions are expected to be in line with this first quarter of 2021, which would represent a significant year-over-year profit growth driven by the improved ethanol market environment, including the restart of our two VCP dry mills and the recovery of the foodservice segment. The Nutrition team delivered 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and solid year-over-year operating profit growth. Human Nutrition results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter. Flavors had an exceptional quarter, driven by strong sales across various market segments, especially beverages.\n\n</tool_response>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"semantic_search\", \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"adjusted earnings per share revenue segment results guidance outlook\", \"doc_id\": \"ectsum_0009\"}}\n</tool_call>\n\n<tool_response>\n[Chunk 45]\n[DOC_ID: ectsum_0009 | COMPANY:  | TYPE: EARNINGS_CALL | PERIOD:  | SECTION: transcript] Animal Nutrition results were in line with the prior year quarter. Amino acids results were lower year-over-year, impacted by lower lysine prices. Looking ahead, we expect Nutrition results to continue to improve, with second quarter results expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2021. For the full year, we expect Nutrition to deliver double-digit operating profit growth. For the Other segment, results were lower year-over-year, primarily due to lower captive insurance results. Looking ahead, we expect Other segment results to be in line with the prior year for the full year. Turning to the corporate line. Unallocated corporate costs for the quarter were $244 million, up from $218 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $82 million, down from $88 million in the prior year quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, down from 18% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.39, up from $0.64 in the prior year quarter. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 8.3%, up from 6.1% in the prior year period. Adjusted ROIC was well above our annual WACC of approximately 5.5%. Looking ahead, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be in the range of 14% to 16%. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for the full year. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $450 million for the full year.

An audio replay will be made available on our website shortly after today's call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Anant Bhalla. Before we speak about third-quarter results, I want to share with you about the progress made in each element of our AEL 2.0 strategy that was first unveiled around this time, last year. We outlined the building blocks in order to execute the strategy, improve returns, and migrate to the capital-efficient business model we envisioned. We introduced the virtuous flywheel of the due [Phonetic] AEL business model going forward. The virtuous flywheel starts with an industry-leading, at-scale annuity origination platform. We delivered a complete refresh of our general account product suite, regained relevance and growth in our IMO distribution channel, and built additional distribution with Eagle Life while adding talent to improve productivity and product economics. Our fundraising abilities through our liability origination platforms allow us to be an investment manager with expertise in both liability-driven asset allocation and to manage an open-architecture investment platform that can source a wide variety of differentiated investments. Over the course of this year, we have established our investment management pillar capabilities necessary to be fully invested in core fixed-income assets managed by BlackRock and Corning, and private assets managed by American Equity or its strategically aligned investment managers. We now have six sleeves [Phonetics] to seven sleeves private asset sectors in which we have conviction, specifically commercial real estate, residential real estate, including mortgages, and single-family rental homes as a landlord. Infrastructure debt and infrastructure equity, middle-market loans to private companies, and lending to recurring revenue, technology or software with an acronym called STARR, with two Rs, sector companies, all of which would allow AEL to deploy an additional couple of billion dollars each year in private assets, demonstrably moving us toward a goal of 30% to 40% in private assets. We now have access to the necessary investment capabilities and scaling to target allocation will allow AEL shareholders to realize the full potential of differentiated asset management with a potentially lower-risk profiles than other alternate business models. Finally, we've got the capital structuring and reinsurance capabilities to then attract third-party risk-bearing capital to this business, either for accessing AEL's at-scale liability origination or for access to both our differentiated asset allocations and our attractive cost of funding liabilities through reinsurance. The former is visible with our first such arrangement being the Brookfield Reinsurance transaction completed this quarter, with attractive fee-like revenues that will drive an evolution of AEL to a higher return on equity or ROE business through building a capital-efficient return on assets or ROA earnings model, thereby both diversifying and improving the quality of earnings. The latter will be our focus with our AEL Bermuda Reinsurance entity that we expect to go live around the end of this year with plans progressing well for it. On the Brookfield Reinsurance transaction, we executed both in-force and new business flow reinsurance, effective July 1. We believe this is a good deal for both parties. For us the weighted average fee of the first $5 billion seeded [Phonetic] to Brookfield, including $4 billion of in-force that was seeded effective July 1 was 97 basis points better than the 90 basis points originally described last October. The forward flow reinsurance fees at 170 basis points for six years to seven years is a meaningfully positive signal on the quality of our liability origination and the strength of our franchise.\n\n</tool_response>\n\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"keyword_search\", \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"net income operating income annuity sales third quarter\", \"doc_id\": \"ectsum_0010\"}}\n</tool_call>\n\n<tool_response>\n[Chunk 48]\n[DOC_ID: ectsum_0010 | COMPANY:  | TYPE: EARNINGS_CALL | PERIOD:  | SECTION: transcript] We generated $1.3 billion in annuity sales in the third quarter, which is a 30% increase over the second quarter of 2021 and a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2020. We are on track to exceed $4 billion in annuity sales for the full year 2021. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $88 million or $1.03 per share in the third quarter. Investment spread was 245 basis points in the third quarter, compared to 255 basis points in the second quarter of 2021. The decrease in spread was primarily driven by a decrease in the cost of options, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of money. We ended the quarter with $44.8 billion in total assets and $42.3 billion in invested assets. We repurchased $50 million of common stock in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $100 million. We have $150 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. We expect to continue to be active in repurchasing shares. We expect investment spread to be in the range of 235 to 255 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2021.

An audio replay will be made available on our website shortly after today's call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Anant Bhalla. Before we speak about third-quarter results, I want to share with you about the progress made in each element of our AEL 2.0 strategy that was first unveiled around this time, last year. We outlined the building blocks in order to execute the strategy, improve returns, and migrate to the capital-efficient business model we envisioned. We introduced the virtuous flywheel of the due [Phonetic] AEL business model going forward. The virtuous flywheel starts with our industry-leading, at-scale annuity origination platform. We delivered a complete refresh of our general account product suite, regained relevance and growth in our IMO distribution channel, and built additional distribution with Eagle Life while adding talent to improve productivity and product economics. Our fundraising abilities through our liability-driven asset allocation and to manage an open-architecture investment platform that can source a wide variety of differentiated investments. Over the course of this year, we have established our investment management pillar capabilities necessary to be fully invested in core fixed-income assets managed by BlackRock and Corning, and private assets managed by American Equity or its strategically aligned investment managers. We now have six sleeves [Phonetics] to seven sleeves private asset sectors in which we have conviction, specifically commercial real estate, residential real estate, including mortgages, and single-family rental homes as a landlord. Infrastructure debt and infrastructure equity, middle-market loans to private companies, and lending to recurring revenue, technology or software with an acronym called STARR, with two Rs, sector companies, all of which would allow AEL to deploy an additional couple of billion dollars each year in private assets, demonstrably moving us toward a goal of 30% to 40% in private assets. We now have access to the necessary investment capabilities and scaling to target allocation will allow AEL shareholders to realize the full potential of differentiated asset management with a potentially lower-risk profiles than other alternate business models. Finally, we've got the capital structuring and reinsurance capabilities to then attract third-party risk-bearing capital to this business, either for accessing AEL's at-scale liability origination or for access to both our differentiated asset allocations and our attractive cost of funding liabilities through reinsurance. The former is visible with our first such arrangement being the Brookfield Reinsurance transaction completed this quarter, with attractive fee-like revenues that will drive an evolution of AEL to a higher return on equity or ROE basis through building a capital-", "loops": 1, "input_tokens": 4253, "output_tokens": 2048, "cost_usd": 0.043479, "latency_ms": 40194, "word_count": 1344, "max_loops_reached": false, "trace": []}

These results were driven by strong property-liability underwriting income of $1.1 billion, which reflects a combined ratio of 87.1. Allstate Protection Plans had excellent results with revenues of $476 million and adjusted net income of $47 million. Investment income was $476 million, and we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Let's move to Slide five to discuss our progress on building Transformative Growth business models. So Transformative Growth, it's a multiyear initiative, and what we're working to do is build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution, and that's going to be accomplished through four areas: expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying new technology ecosystem. In Transformative Growth, you wouldn't do it all in one day, of course, so it's got five phases, and substantial progress has been made in Phases two and three. Phase two successes include improving the competitive price position of auto insurance, protecting margins by reducing costs. New advertising was launched with increased investment. We also are off to an excellent start with National General. And of course, the phases overlap, so progress is also being made in Phase three. So we're transforming the distribution platform, including supporting transition of Allstate agents to higher-growth and lower-cost models, which we'll discuss on the next slide. Improving customer acquisition sophistication will lower cost relative to lifetime value. We continue to focus on lowering underwriting claims expenses to deliver lower-cost protection to customers, and we've designed a new technology architecture.\n\n</tool_response>\n\nAllstate's Q3 earnings call highlights strong financial performance and strategic progress.

Return on equity was 23.8% over the trailing 12 months. Allstate Protection Plans posted revenues of $476 million (up 22% YoY) and adjusted net income of $47 million (up 57%). Net investment income was $476 million, though management guided future quarterly investment income to approximately $350 million as performance-based returns normalize. The company returned $1.1 billion to shareholders via $900 million in buybacks and $200 million in dividends, with $2.4 billion remaining on its repurchase authorization and $3.5 billion in deployable capital.
