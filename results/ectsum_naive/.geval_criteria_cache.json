Numerical Accuracy\n\n**Score 1:** Summary contains multiple incorrect figures or calculations. Example: Original states \"revenue increased 12% YoY to $4.2B,\" but summary claims \"revenue grew 20% to $4.5B.\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary contains mostly accurate figures with 1-2 minor errors (e.g., rounding differences, one misquoted percentage that doesn't materially affect interpretation).\n\n**Score 5:** All material financial figures, percentages, and calculated metrics match source documents exactly or reflect appropriate rounding/presentation conventions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Claim-to-Source Attribution\n\n**Score 1:** Summary presents forward-looking statements or management claims as facts without qualification, or attributes management quotes to financial data. Example: Summarizing \"we expect 8% growth\" as \"company will grow 8%.\"\n\n**Score 3:** Most claims are properly attributed to their source (management guidance vs. reported results, analyst estimates vs. company statements), with occasional missing qualifiers like \"management stated\" or \"guidance indicates.\"\n\n**Score 5:** Every material claim includes appropriate attribution. Reported results, guidance, estimates, and opinions are clearly distinguished; cautionary language preserved where present in original.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Context Completeness for Material Changes\n\n**Score 1:** Summary reports a significant financial metric change without explaining drivers. Example: \"Operating margin declined to 22%\" without mentioning the one-time restructuring charge that caused it.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary mentions drivers of major changes but omits some context (e.g., notes margin decline but doesn't specify whether it's structural or temporary).\n\n**Score 5:** All material metric changes include relevant contextual factors: one-time items vs. recurring, segment-level drivers, prior-year comparisons, and management commentary on causes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Selectivity Bias Detection\n\n**Score 1:** Summary systematically omits unfavorable metrics or news while highlighting positive items. Example: Including strong revenue growth but omitting margin compression, rising debt, or negative guidance.\n\n**Score 3:** Summary is mostly balanced but slightly over-represents positive or negative information (e.g., two positive items given disproportionate space relative to one significant headwind).\n\n**Score 5:** Summary proportionally represents all material positive and negative information; emphasis reflects significance in source document, not editorial bias.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conditional Language Fidelity\n\n**Score 1:** Summary removes hedging language and probability qualifiers entirely. Example: Original says \"we may face supply chain headwinds\" becomes \"we will face supply chain headwinds\" in summary.\n\n**Score 3:** Most qualifiers preserved, but some uncertainty language is softened or sharpened inappropriately (e.g., \"could\" becomes \"may\" or vice versa, or one instance of removing \"if\" conditions).\n\n**Score 5:** Conditional language, uncertainty markers, and management caveats (\"subject to,\" \"approximately,\" \"we believe,\" \"risks include\") are preserved with original meaning intact; probability language is not altered.",
  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:coverage": "# Financial Document Summarization: Coverage Rubric\n\n## 1. Key Financial Metrics Inclusion\n\n**Score 1:** Summary mentions only revenue figures. Example: \"Company reported Q3 revenue of $2.5B\" but omits gross margin (58%), operating income ($480M), and EPS ($1.22).\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes 3-4 major metrics. Example: Covers revenue, operating income, and EPS, but misses gross margin, free cash flow, or debt-to-equity ratio discussed in the source.\n\n**Score 5:** Summary captures all material financial metrics discussed (revenue, profitability, margins, cash flow, leverage ratios, guidance). Example: \"Revenue $2.5B (+12% YoY), operating income $480M, EPS $1.22, FCF $310M, net debt $1.8B with 2.1x leverage.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. Segment/Business Line Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** No breakdown by business segment or geography. Example: Single revenue number for a diversified company with 5 distinct operating segments.\n\n**Score 3:** Covers 1-2 major segments. Example: Summarizes North America and International regions but omits Product vs. Services split, or mentions only largest 2 of 4 business units.\n\n**Score 5:** All material segments/geographies mentioned with performance data. Example: Covers North America (+8%), EMEA (+6%), Asia-Pacific (-2%); Product segment ($1.2B, +15%), Services ($1.3B, +9%).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Management Commentary & Outlook Representation\n\n**Score 1:** Missing forward-looking statements entirely. Example: Summary contains only historical results with no guidance, management priorities, or strategic direction.\n\n**Score 3:** Includes some forward guidance or 1-2 management priorities. Example: \"Company guided FY revenue to $11-12B\" but omits discussion of margin trajectory, investment priorities, or competitive positioning commentary.\n\n**Score 5:** Captures management guidance (near and long-term), strategic priorities, and risk factors discussed. Example: \"2025 guidance $11-12B; prioritizing AI investments; warned of supply chain headwinds; sees margin expansion opportunity.\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. Variance Explanation Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** Reports changes without explaining drivers. Example: \"Operating margin fell to 18%\" with no explanation of why.\n\n**Score 3:** Explains causes for 50-70% of material variances. Example: Explains revenue growth drivers (price +5%, volume +7%) but doesn't address why operating margin declined; misses explanation of one major cost increase.\n\n**Score 5:** Identifies root causes for all material variances. Example: \"Revenue +12% from volume growth in enterprise segment (+8%) and price increases (+4%); margin compression of 200 bps driven by wage inflation ($60M impact) partially offset by productivity gains ($30M).\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Event Coverage\n\n**Score 1:** Summary focuses only on income statement; ignores balance sheet or cash flow items. Example: No mention of share buybacks, dividend changes, debt issuance, acquisition, or cash position.\n\n**Score 3:** Mentions 1-2 balance sheet/cash flow items. Example: Notes \"repurchased $500M in stock\" and \"ended quarter with $2.1B cash\" but omits working capital changes, capex guidance, or new debt arrangements discussed.\n\n**Score 5:** Covers material balance sheet changes, cash deployment, and liquidity. Example: \"Repurchased $500M shares; raised $1B debt at 4.2%; capex guidance $300M; ended with $2.1B cash, 2.1x net leverage; working capital declined $50M.\""
