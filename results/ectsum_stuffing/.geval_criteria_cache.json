  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001:faithfulness": "# Faithfulness Rubric for Financial Document Summarization\n\n## 1. Numerical Accuracy\n\n**Score 1:** Summary contains incorrect figures that materially misrepresent performance.\n- *Example:* Original states \"Revenue increased 12% YoY to $2.5B\"; summary claims \"Revenue grew 25% to $3.2B\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary presents correct headline figures but omits important qualifications or segment-level details.\n- *Example:* Summary states \"Net income was $500M\" but omits that this excludes a $200M one-time charge that should be noted for investment analysis\n\n**Score 5:** All reported numbers match source documents exactly, with appropriate precision and necessary context about adjustments or non-GAAP measures clearly preserved.\n- *Example:* \"Adjusted EBITDA was $850M (excluding $75M restructuring charges)\" accurately reflects source without distortion\n\n---\n\n## 2. Attribution Fidelity for Forward-Looking Statements\n\n**Score 1:** Summary presents management guidance or projections as if they are established facts without qualification.\n- *Example:* Original: \"We expect 8-10% growth next year\"; Summary: \"Growth will accelerate to 10%\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes forward-looking statements but loses nuance about confidence levels or conditional language.\n- *Example:* Original: \"We anticipate margins could improve to 18% *if* cost initiatives succeed\"; Summary: \"Margins are expected to improve to 18%\"\n\n**Score 5:** All forward-looking statements are clearly marked as management guidance with appropriate hedging language preserved (e.g., \"expect,\" \"could,\" \"assuming,\" \"subject to\").\n- *Example:* \"Management projects 8-10% revenue growth, contingent on market conditions remaining stable\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Critical Context Preservation\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits material context that reverses the interpretation of a key metric.\n- *Example:* Original explains declining margins due to deliberate investment in R&D; summary reports margin decline without explanation, implying operational deterioration\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes major context but misses second-order factors that sophisticated investors would consider.\n- *Example:* Notes that revenue fell 5% but omits that 8% of decline was from divested business (so organic decline was only 3%)\n\n**Score 5:** Summary preserves all material qualifications, including one-time items, accounting changes, acquisition impacts, and business model shifts affecting metric interpretation.\n- *Example:* \"Operating income declined 15%, primarily due to $120M gain on asset sale in prior year; underlying operations grew 4%\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. Absence of False Causal Inference\n\n**Score 1:** Summary creates causal relationships not stated in source or directly contradicts source causality.\n- *Example:* Original attributes margin pressure to \"competitive pricing\"; summary claims \"operational inefficiency caused margin compression\"\n\n**Score 3:** Summary is technically accurate but implies a tighter causal link than source language justifies.\n- *Example:* Original: \"supply chain improvements *may contribute* to cost savings\"; Summary: \"supply chain improvements drove cost reduction\"\n\n**Score 5:** Summary maintains source language precision on causality, distinguishing between stated causes, correlated factors, and management's tentative explanations.\n- *Example:* \"Management attributed the 3% margin improvement to labor efficiency gains and cited favorable FX headwinds as a secondary factor\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Completeness of Disclosed Risks and Headwinds\n\n**Score 1:** Summary omits material risks or concerns explicitly discussed, creating overly positive impression.\n- *Example:* Original discusses \"significant regulatory uncertainty in key markets\" and \"customer concentration risk\"; summary mentions neither\n\n**Score 3:** Summary includes some risks but loses critical detail needed for risk assessment, or buries headwinds in positive framing.\n- *Example:* Original details three specific supply chain vulnerabilities; summary vaguely notes \"supply chain challenges exist\"\n\n**Score 5:** Summary identifies and briefly characterizes all material risks, regulatory concerns, and acknowledged headwinds discussed in source with appropriate specificity.\n- *Example:* \"Management noted three risks: (1) pending antitrust review in EU market affecting 22% of revenue, (2) customer concentration with top-3 clients representing 45% of sales, (3) exposure to commodity price volatility in Q3-Q4\"",
